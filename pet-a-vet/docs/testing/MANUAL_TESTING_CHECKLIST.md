# üîç MANUAL BROWSER TESTING CHECKLIST - FINAL VERIFICATION

## TESTING STATUS: ‚úÖ READY FOR MANUAL VERIFICATION

The development server is running at **http://localhost:3000** and all code fixes have been implemented. Follow this checklist to verify all fixes are working correctly.

## üéØ PRIMARY FIXES TO VERIFY

### 1. ‚úÖ DATE STORAGE BUG FIX

**Issue**: Appointments booked for specific dates (e.g., June 18th) were appearing on the next day (June 19th) after page refresh.

**Fix Applied**:

- Fixed date/time extraction functions in `app/api/appointments/route.ts`
- Use local date components instead of ISO string manipulation
- Timezone-safe date creation using manual date construction

**Testing Steps**:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Log in (try credentials: admin@example.com / password)
3. Go to Appointments page
4. Book an appointment for a specific date (e.g., June 18, 2025)
5. Note the date you selected
6. Refresh the page or navigate away and back
7. **VERIFY**: The appointment appears on the SAME date you selected (no date shifting)

### 2. ‚úÖ 30-MINUTE TIME SLOT INTERVALS

**Issue**: Time slots were only hourly (9:00, 10:00, 11:00)

**Fix Applied**:

- Updated `app/api/appointments/available-times/route.ts` to generate 30-minute intervals
- Enhanced overlap detection for 30-minute slots

**Testing Steps**:

1. In the appointment booking dialog
2. Select a date and veterinarian
3. Check the time dropdown options
4. **VERIFY**: You see 30-minute intervals like:
   - 9:00 AM, 9:30 AM, 10:00 AM, 10:30 AM, 11:00 AM, 11:30 AM, etc.

### 3. ‚úÖ SERVICE TYPE MAPPING FIX

**Issue**: API was trying to store values like 'CHECK_UP' but database only accepts 'MEDICAL' and 'GROOMING'

**Fix Applied**:

- Added `mapServiceType()` function to convert service types
- CHECK_UP, VACCINATION, etc. ‚Üí MEDICAL
- GROOMING ‚Üí GROOMING

**Testing Steps**:

1. Book an appointment with type "Check-up"
2. **VERIFY**: The appointment is created successfully (no errors)
3. Check that the appointment type shows as "MEDICAL" in the database/API

### 4. ‚úÖ TIME CONFLICT DETECTION

**Issue**: Enhanced overlap detection needed for 30-minute slots

**Fix Applied**:

- Updated overlap logic to handle variable appointment durations
- Improved conflict detection for 30-minute time slots

**Testing Steps**:

1. Book an appointment at 10:30 AM
2. Try to book another appointment with the SAME veterinarian at 10:30 AM
3. **VERIFY**: You get a conflict error message
4. Try booking at 11:00 AM (different time)
5. **VERIFY**: This booking succeeds

## üß™ DETAILED TESTING WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Access the Application

1. Open browser to http://localhost:3000
2. If prompted to log in, try these credentials:
   - Email: admin@example.com
   - Password: password (or check database for valid users)

### Step 2: Navigate to Appointments

1. Go to the Appointments section/page
2. You should see a calendar and appointment list

### Step 3: Test Date Storage Fix

1. Click "Book Appointment"
2. Select:
   - Pet: Any available pet
   - Visit Type: Check-up
   - Veterinarian: Any available vet
   - **Date: June 18, 2025** (or any future date)
   - Time: Any available time
3. Book the appointment
4. **Note the date displayed in the appointment list**
5. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
6. **CRITICAL CHECK**: Verify the appointment still shows June 18, 2025 (no date shift)

### Step 4: Test 30-Minute Time Slots

1. Open booking dialog again
2. Select date and veterinarian
3. Open the time dropdown
4. **VERIFY**: You see times like 9:00 AM, 9:30 AM, 10:00 AM, 10:30 AM, etc.

### Step 5: Test Time Conflict Detection

1. Book appointment at 10:30 AM
2. Try to book another appointment:
   - Same veterinarian
   - Same date
   - Same time (10:30 AM)
3. **VERIFY**: You get an error about time conflict
4. Change time to 11:00 AM and try again
5. **VERIFY**: This time it works

### Step 6: Test Service Type Mapping

1. Book appointments with different visit types:
   - Check-up ‚Üí Should map to MEDICAL
   - Vaccination ‚Üí Should map to MEDICAL
   - Grooming ‚Üí Should map to GROOMING
2. **VERIFY**: All appointments are created successfully

## üèÜ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### ‚úÖ ALL FIXES WORKING IF:

- [ ] Appointments appear on the correct dates (no date shifting)
- [ ] Time slots show 30-minute intervals (9:00, 9:30, 10:00, 10:30, etc.)
- [ ] Time conflicts are properly detected and prevented
- [ ] All service types can be booked successfully
- [ ] Date/time display is consistent after page refresh

### ‚ùå ISSUES FOUND IF:

- [ ] Appointments appear on different dates after refresh
- [ ] Only hourly time slots are available
- [ ] Multiple appointments can be booked at same time/vet
- [ ] Service type errors occur during booking
- [ ] Date/time display changes after refresh

## üìÅ KEY FILES MODIFIED

- `app/api/appointments/route.ts` - Main API with date/time fixes
- `app/api/appointments/available-times/route.ts` - 30-minute slots
- `app/dashboard/appointments/page.tsx` - Frontend booking interface

## üéØ EXPECTED RESULTS

All four major issues should be resolved:

1. **Date Storage**: No more date shifting bugs
2. **Time Slots**: 30-minute intervals available
3. **Service Mapping**: All service types work
4. **Conflict Detection**: Proper overlap prevention

## üìû IF ISSUES FOUND

If any of the above tests fail, note:

1. Which specific test failed
2. What you expected vs. what happened
3. Any error messages shown
4. Browser console errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)

The fixes are implemented and the server is running - manual testing will confirm everything is working correctly!
