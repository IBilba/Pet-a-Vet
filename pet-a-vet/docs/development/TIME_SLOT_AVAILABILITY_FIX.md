# Time Slot Availability Fix

## Issue Summary

We identified and fixed issues with the appointment time slot availability system:

1. **Missing Time Slots**: Some valid time slots (e.g., 10:00 AM) were not being displayed as available even though they should have been.
2. **Incorrect Blocking**: After booking an appointment at 9:30 AM, the 9:00 AM slot was incorrectly shown as unavailable.
3. **Inconsistent Duration Handling**: Appointments were being created with a 60-minute duration despite the database schema defining a 30-minute default.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Duration Inconsistency**:

   - The database schema defined a default appointment duration of 30 minutes
   - However, the code was setting appointment durations to 60 minutes during creation
   - The availability check was using 60-minute durations when filtering available slots

2. **Overlap Detection Logic**:
   - The overlap detection algorithm was treating appointments as 60-minute blocks
   - This caused time slots to be incorrectly marked as unavailable
   - For example, a 9:30 AM appointment was blocking the 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM slots

## Solution Implemented

We implemented the following fixes:

1. **Consistent Duration Handling**:

   - Updated all appointment creation code to use 30-minute durations, matching the database schema
   - Modified the time slot availability checks to use 30-minute durations consistently

2. **Improved Overlap Detection**:

   - Refined the algorithm to correctly handle 30-minute appointment slots
   - Ensured only the exact appointment times are blocked, not adjacent slots
   - Fixed slot end time calculation to match the duration setting

3. **Booking Validation**:
   - Updated the conflict detection to properly check for 30-minute overlaps
   - Ensured appointments can be made at any available 30-minute interval

## Files Modified

1. `app/api/appointments/available-times/route.ts`:

   - Updated overlap detection logic to use 30-minute durations
   - Fixed time slot filtering to correctly identify available slots

2. `app/api/appointments/route.ts`:
   - Changed appointment creation to use 30-minute durations
   - Updated conflict checking to use the correct duration

## Testing

The fix has been verified with a test script that simulates booking appointments and checking available time slots. The script confirms:

1. When booking a 9:30 AM appointment:

   - The 9:30 AM slot is properly marked as unavailable
   - The 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM slots remain available

2. When booking a 10:30 AM appointment (in addition to 9:30 AM):
   - Both 9:30 AM and 10:30 AM slots are marked as unavailable
   - All other slots (including 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM) remain available

This confirms that the appointment system now correctly handles 30-minute time slots and only blocks the exact appointment times.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Configurable Durations**:

   - Consider adding a UI option for selecting different appointment durations
   - Implement support for variable durations based on service type

2. **Schedule Visualization**:

   - Add a calendar view showing all booked appointments
   - Use color-coding to indicate availability and appointment types

3. **Testing**:
   - Add automated tests for appointment scheduling
   - Include edge cases like back-to-back appointments
   - Test scheduling near business hour boundaries
