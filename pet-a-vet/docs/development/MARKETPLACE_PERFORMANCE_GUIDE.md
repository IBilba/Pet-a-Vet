# Marketplace Performance Optimization Guide

## Optimizations Implemented

We've made several optimizations to improve the performance and user experience of the marketplace:

### 1. Improved Data Loading and UI Experience

- **Loading States**: Implemented skeleton loading states that better represent the actual content
- **AbortController**: Added proper cleanup with AbortController to prevent race conditions
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling with graceful fallbacks
- **Data Flow**: Improved data flow between checkout and confirmation pages

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- **Memoization**: Used React.memo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Debouncing**: Added debouncing for search operations to reduce API calls
- **Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of effects and timers to prevent memory leaks
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized rendering paths to prevent UI flickering

### 3. Testing Tools

- **Performance Hooks**: Created custom hooks to measure and monitor performance
- **Performance Testing**: Added a test script for measuring key performance metrics
- **Monitoring**: Set up performance monitoring utilities for ongoing quality assurance

## Usage Guidelines

### Performance Monitoring

Use the performance monitoring tools to identify bottlenecks:

```tsx
// In your component:
import {
  usePerformanceMetrics,
  useRenderTiming,
} from "@/hooks/use-performance";

export function MyComponent() {
  // Log render times for this component
  useRenderTiming("MyComponent");

  // Get performance metrics
  const metrics = usePerformanceMetrics();

  // Component code...
}
```

### Running Performance Tests

To run the performance tests:

1. Ensure the application is running locally (`npm run dev`)
2. Install Puppeteer if needed: `npm install puppeteer --save-dev`
3. Run the test: `npx ts-node performance-test.ts`

### Common Performance Issues to Watch For

1. **API Calls Inside Render Paths**: Avoid fetching data directly in render functions
2. **Missing Cleanup**: Always clean up effects, subscriptions, and timers
3. **Missing Keys in Lists**: Ensure all list items have stable, unique keys
4. **Unnecessary Re-renders**: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback appropriately
5. **Large Bundle Sizes**: Split code into smaller chunks and lazy-load where possible

## Maintenance Checklist

When making changes to the marketplace:

- [ ] Run performance tests before and after changes
- [ ] Check for memory leaks using React DevTools Profiler
- [ ] Verify proper loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Test on both fast and slow network connections
- [ ] Test on mobile devices for responsiveness
- [ ] Check accessibility with screen readers

## Known Limitations

- The performance test requires Puppeteer which needs to be installed separately
- Performance metrics in development mode will be slower than production
- Some optimizations may need to be adjusted based on specific backend response times

## Future Improvements

Next Steps
The implemented optimizations should significantly improve the performance and user experience of the marketplace. Here are some recommendations for further improvements:

- Code Splitting: Implement React.lazy and Suspense for component code splitting
- Image Optimization: Use next/image for automatic image optimization
- Server-Side Rendering: Leverage Next.js SSR capabilities for critical pages
- E2E Testing: Add comprehensive end-to-end tests to ensure the entire flow works correctly
- Accessibility Auditing: Conduct a full accessibility audit and fix any issues
